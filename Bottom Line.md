Bottom Line
Quantum computing could revolutionize parts of the gambling tech stack — especially:

Security

Personalization

Fraud detection

Game fairness

But we’re still in the early adoption phase. Leading gaming firms like Flutter should be experimenting now, especially in areas like:

Fraud analytics

RNG

Secure payments

If you're interested, I can help sketch out a quantum adoption roadmap or a pilot project proposal for a company like Flutter. Want to go that route?
