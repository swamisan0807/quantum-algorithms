======================================================================================================

⬇️ Setup and Run Instructions
Copy all the code files above into a new folder on your machine.

Run pip install -r requirements.txt.
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

If desired, generate HTTPS certificates and uncomment the ssl_context line in app.py.

Run python app.py and open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

Now you have a ready-to-hack repository structure and complete code for a quantum-enhanced poker PoC platform with quantum cryptography and ML fraud detection, demo-ready for presentations or further engineering.

If you want improvements (file upload for user input, cloud deployment scripts, Dockerfile, detailed diagrams), let me know!

pip install --upgrade qiskit qiskit-aer scikit-learn numpy
